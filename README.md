# Contrast Ratio

Forked from [siege-media/contrast-ratio](https://github.com/siege-media/contrast-ratio) (and detached from it)
after Lea Verou sold the domain contrast-ratio.com to SEO company Siege Media
and ownership of the GitHub repository was transferred from the original developer to the aforementioned company.
(See [Contrast Ratio has a new home â€” and this is great news!](https://lea.verou.me/2023/03/contrast-ratio-new-home/) (18.03.2023)
on Lea Verou's website.)
